ðŸ›  Make a local working copy of your repository

How you create a local clone of your repository depends on how you are used to working with `git`. Assuming that you are using the `git` command line and have `ssh` configured:

- copy the `ssh` clone URI from GitHub (as shown above)
- Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to a suitable working folder
- run `git clone git@github.com:username/my-repo.git`, replacing the `git` URI with your own
