title: Submission Templates
subject: Reference

The repository is expected to contain a [Reproducible Executation Environment Specification (REES)](https://repo2docker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/specification.html), the configuration files for your [MyST Markdown](https://mystmd.org) or [Quarto](https://quarto.org) project and your content (`.md`/`.qmd`/`.ipynb`), code, images and data files.

The goal of these template repositories is to serve the same purpose as a $\LaTeX$ submission template: something that authors can copy, delete content, and replace with their notebooks, data and articles.

Submission templates are available via the [Notebooks Now! GitHub Organization (github.com/Notebooks-Now)](https://github.com/Notebooks-Now).
