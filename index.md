title: Notebooks Now! Submission Guide
subject: Introduction
---

[Notebooks Now!](https://data.agu.org/notebooks-now/) is a community-driven effort led by AGU under a grant from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation to define standards and workflows for publishing with Computational Notebooks.

The project is establishing Computational Notebook as a format for submission of research articles, further enabling reproducibility and interactivity within research publications, and elevating the notebook-based format as a primary element of the scientific record. In addition, we suggest a machine readable approach is taken for all submission metadata and content.

This website provides guidance for authors on how to prepare a notebook based manuscript and repository for the AGU Notebooks Now submission, review and publication system. There is reference throughout this guide to existing community materials, existing or emerging standards, and tools to help with the workflow. This guide is not meant to be comprehensive in those aspects, however, instead be a curated community resource to point to best-practices and provide a guide to submitting research for AGU journals.

:::{note} In Progress
This resource is in the process of being built, and is not complete in all aspects, especially with regard to submission and peer-review. Many pages solicit feedback for improvements from the Notebooks Now working groups who are the primary contributors at the moment. For more information, see the [contributing guide](./contributing.md).

## Submission Templates

Submissions are made by either providing a link to a public github repository or uploading a `.zip` file with the contents of your private repository. Although it's possible to put together your own repository with the minimum requirements for submission, there are a number of template repositories available as a starting point.
