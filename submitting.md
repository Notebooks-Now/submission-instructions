## What to expect

On submission the system will immediately run a number of automated checks. This includes checks on the metadata you've provided, your manuscript content, reproducible environment and whether your notebooks could be executed successfully.

You'll see immediate feedback on these checks and will be able to address any that fail before resubmitting. You can resubmit multiple times and once all checks pass you'll be prompted to finalize you submission for peer review and receive a link to your submission's status page.
