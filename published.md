## Published Notebooks

- Currently published notebooks will be a specific article type called “Research Articles: Computational Notebooks” in selected AGU Journals. This model can be easily adopted by other journals and publishers.
- The published notebook will be considered as an archival record. Further changes will be “locked,” requiring an erratum or correction.
- The text of the notebook will be copy edited and proofed as usual by the journal.
- The notebook and journal article will receive a single DOI that will resolve to the Notebook landing page (with a link back to the journal article). An HTML and PDF view is supported also on the Notebook landing page. The journal view will provide an immediate link to the Notebook.
- The Notebook will be included in the Journal contents and will be indexed in downstream services that provide a record of that journal (MedLine, ADS, ACS abstracts, GeoRef, Web of Science, Scopes, etc). If authors include their ORCID, they will receive a publication record automatically after publication.
- All Notebooks will be published as Open Access under a mixed open license, where the text, figures, and tables are under a CC-BY 4.0 license, data are under a CC0 license, and code is under an open software license. Further information is included in the templates.

## Publication Process

The following steps to publishing your computational notebook are specific to publishing in AGU’s Earth and Space Science (ESS), the pilot journal for NotebooksNow! The section will be updated as new journals and publishers are added.

- **Pre-Submission**: Author prepares Research Article: Computational Notebook submission following the Author Instructions outlined on this website and following the [ESS general author instructions](https://earthandspacescience-submit.agu.org/cgi-bin/main.plex?form_type=display_auth_instructions) and policy requirements.
- **Submission**: Curvenote transfers draft submission to ESS submission and peer-review platform (GEMS). The authors will be notified when this is done. Author completes submission in ESS GEMS platform. Journal staff does Quality Control checks and works with authors until the submission is ready to hand over to the journal Editor-in-Chief (EIC).
- **Peer-review**: Submission goes through the peer-review process. Information on AGU’s journals peer review policies are available on their [Publication Policies page](https://www.agu.org/publish-with-agu/publish/agu-publications-policies).
- **Revision**: If not rejected, author prepares the revised notebook (science and editing) to address review comments. Author contacts Curvenote with revision draft to initiate a revised submission. Some additional information may be needed to be provided by the authors in GEMS (e.g., a file containing the response to the reviews). The submission will then go through any re-review process before receiving a final decision.
- **Production**: Your article will then be sent to Curvenote and AGU’s publishing partner, Wiley, for production (copyediting, typesetting, proofreading). You will be asked to sign a copyright/license form by Wiley’s author services – you should select the same license as for the text, figure, and table content of the notebook (e.g., CC-BY 4.0). You will be communicating with Wiley and Curvenote directly throughout the process.
- **Publication**: Your Research Article: Computational Notebook will receive a single DOI that will resolve to the Notebook landing page (with a link back to the ESS journal article). An HTML and PDF view is supported also on the Notebook landing page. The journal view will provide an immediate link to the Notebook.

## Publication Requirements and Policies

- **Publication Policies and Ethical Guidelines**: In addition to meeting the requirements outlined in this author instructions, all authors are expected to adhere to the AGU journals’ **[publication policies](https://www.agu.org/publish-with-agu/publish/agu-publications-policies)** and **[ethical guidelines](https://www.agu.org/Publish-with-AGU/Publish/Author-Resources/Policies/Scientific-ethics-policy)** when submitting a manuscript. All new [data and software for submissions](https://www.agu.org/Publish-with-AGU/Publish/Author-Resources/Data-and-Software-for-Authors) should be placed into community-accepted, trusted repositories (not in supporting information).
- **Publication Fees**: Information about the costs for publishing in ESS is provided on the [AGU Publication Fees page](https://www.agu.org/publish-with-agu/publish/author-resources/publication-fees-funding-options). AGU is committed to inclusive and equitable scientific publishing and provides funding options for authors, including full waivers. All accepted papers will be published regardless of the author’s ability to pay publication fees, more information is provided on the [AGU Funding Support page](https://www.agu.org/publish-with-agu/publish/author-resources/publication-fees-funding-options).
