This guide will take you through the process of preparing your submission, from initial repository setup, through suggested authoring workflows to final submission checks and using the submission system.

You will use one of the templates available in the [Notebooks Now GitHub Organization](https://github.com/notebooks-now). There are templates for single notebook submissions ("lite") and Markdown based manuscript submissions with linked notebooks ("full") for each of the supported tool chains.

In this guide you will use the "full" template for MyST Markdown or Quarto.

We've focussed on the "full" template as this gives the most freedom over the manuscript's narrative flow and avoids some of the difficulties encoountered when trying to compose the whole paper in a single notebook file.

For more information on the single notebook approach see the "lite" templates in [Submission Templates](/templates).
```
