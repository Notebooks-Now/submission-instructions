The AGU submission guide is a community resource that is open to contributions from the wider community. Contribute by opening and issue or pull request with changes or additions. The license for the resource is `CC-BY-4.0`, which allows you to reuse portions of this work in other places with attribution to the AGU Notebooks Now! project.

We are actively looking for help and pointers in many places in the documentation, the guide is not meant to be comprehensive on all aspects of writing or programming, and builds upon community standards. If you believe a community standard should be included, please let us know through an issue (or reaching out on the Notebooks Now slack!).
